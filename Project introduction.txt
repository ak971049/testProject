Social media platforms' emergence and rapid growth have revolutionized how businesses operate and communicate with their customers. Today, social media has become an integral part of business processes and plays a crucial role in decision-making within management information systems (MIS). This report aims to explore the profound influence of social media on business processes and MIS decision-making. Social media platforms have transformed the way businesses interact with their target audience, enabling them to reach a wider customer base and engage in real-time conversations. 
With millions of users actively participating in various social media channels, businesses have gained unprecedented access to valuable consumer insights, preferences, and feedback. These insights offer companies a competitive advantage by allowing them to tailor their products, services, and marketing strategies to meet customer demands effectively. 
It is realistic to expect that social networks will have an impact on several sectors, notably the field of marketing, according to Taborosi, Kovaevi, and Maljugi (2022). Trends in various socio-economic and political arenas, as well as in the fashion and tourist industries, are good indicators of this effect.
Bulmer and DiMauro (2011) assert that social media and information technology have changed business in general and that the new online engagement model has significantly impacted the decision-making abilities of CEOs and managers. 
Throughout this report, we will delve into the various ways social media impacts business processes and explore the implications for decision-making within management information systems. By examining relevant case studies and academic research, we will gain insights into the opportunities, challenges, and best practices associated with incorporating social media into business operations and MIS decision-making.
